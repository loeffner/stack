Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order implement here is LIFO (Last In First Out)

- Push: Add an item to the stack. This library provides an option for automatic resizing if the stack is full.
- Pop: 	Remove an item from the stack. The items are popped in reversed order in which they are pushed.
		Underflow conditions are caught.
- Peek: Returns the top element of the stack without popping it.
- isEmpty: Returns true if the stack is empty, else false.
